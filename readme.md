# chat modifier CRAZYYY
what this bot does is it takes a webhook and will erase your messages and replace them with chatgpt ones, so you can make everyone talk like cavemen or... dare i say it... FURRIES!??!!??!?!?!!!

## commands
use /personality to pick a specific personality

use /boring to pick a random personality

## how to make it work
copy settings.template.json to settings.json and fill in the values

- create a bot using discord developer portal and put the bot token in the bot token section, then add the bot to the server you want it in

- create a webhook in the channel you want messages to be modified in (bot has to be in the server)

- create a openai api key and put it into openaiKey (this costs moolah)

then make sure you have the requirements in requirements.txt

then run main.py and its done!!!
